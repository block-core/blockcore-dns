# Blockcore DNS

Domain Name System Server that utilizes Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for updates

## Introduction

The help mitigate infrastructure attacks, such as shutdown of cloud-hosted services, we allow anyone to host and run our software. This will make it harder to have any efficient attacks against our networks.

The Blockcore DNS is a type of Dynamic DNS ([DDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS)) that allows a semi-trust or no-trust setups where anyone that runs Blockcore software can become part of the ecosystem.

Anyone can run the Blockcore DNS software for their own domain, and can allow anyone or approved-list of hosters to be part of their official DNS.
